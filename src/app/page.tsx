          <p>
            Hello! I am Azimet Kerem Ersoy, a 23-year-old web developer and a fourth-year student at Kırıkkale
            University Computer Engineering. I have been living in Ankara, which I love very much, for the last 23
            years. I live in Kırıkkale during my university years, but I often return to Ankara, balancing my academic
            studies with the vibrant life of the capital.
          </p>
          <p>
            I find immense joy in exploring new places and gaining fresh experiences. My curiosity drives me to spend
            countless hours in front of my computer, delving into research and uncovering new technologies and
            methodologies. This passion for continuous learning has been a cornerstone of my personal and professional
            growth.
          </p>
          <p>
            Starting my professional journey early during my college years has been incredibly rewarding. Working while
            studying taught me invaluable lessons in time management, project management, team communication and
            industry knowledge. These experiences have shaped me into a well-rounded person ready to tackle complex
            challenges with innovative solutions.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a full-stack web developer, I am eager to leverage the latest technologies in my projects. My journey
            began with an internship at Pepteam in Ankara, where I quickly advanced to become the sole web developer.
            One of my significant achievements at Pepteam was integrating our mobile application with the{' '}
            <CustomizedLink href="https://www.pepteam.net">web</CustomizedLink>, where I tackled and resolved complex
            challenges using technologies such as <CustomizedLink href="https://nextjs.org/">Next.js</CustomizedLink>,{' '}

          </p>
          <p>
            I have also worked on a full-stack project with SetCrews, where I brought project owner Sacit Altun
            Bey&rsquo;s vision to life. This project, targeting end users, is currently live and actively used. The
            technologies I employed in this project include{' '}

          <p>
            In addition to my professional endeavors, I am committed to volunteer work and continuous learning. As the
            Web Team Leader at GDSC KKU, a{' '}

            , I lead a team of developers, fostering a collaborative and innovative environment. I also participated in{' '}
            <CustomizedLink href="https://yetkingencler.com/">YetGen</CustomizedLink>, a 12-week program led by Prof.
            Dr. Erhan Erkut, which provided me with a solid foundation in algorithm development, teamwork, and social
            innovation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Outside of my technical pursuits, I cherish the time spent exploring new places and gaining diverse
            experiences. This blend of technical expertise and a zest for life allows me to approach problems with a
            fresh perspective and a well-rounded approach.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am excited about the future and the opportunities that lie ahead. I am eager to continue learning,
            growing, and contributing to projects that make a difference in the world. I am always open to new
            experiences and collaborations, so feel free to reach out to me if you have a project in mind or just want
            to chat!
